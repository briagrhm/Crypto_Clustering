# Crypto_Clustering

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised learning to process data, cluster reduce your dimensions, andto reduce the principal components using PCA. These skills will be used to create an analysis of cryptocurrency data to help a client looking to get into the crypto currency market. 

## Results 

The results show that from the preprocessing data we were able to determine there are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. 

We then produced and elbow curve by clustering the Crytocurrencies Using K-Means and found that the best k value is 4. This tells us an output of 4 is a good number to categorize our clusters.

We then visualized the cryptocurrency results using 3D scatter with clusters

This 2-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to two principal components. The outliers were able to visualized.

## Summary 
We have identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
